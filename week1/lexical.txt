In lexical analysis, a set of symbols is crucial for understanding and processing code. Keywords such as 'break,' 'case,' 'char,' and 'while' play a pivotal role in defining the structure and logic of programming languages. Built-in functions like 'clrscr(),' 'printf(),' and 'scanf()' provide essential functionalities for input and output operations. Operators such as '+,' '-,' '*,' and '/' facilitate mathematical computations and comparisons, while special symbols like '@,' '#,' '$,' and '_' add uniqueness to identifiers. Separators like ',' ':' ';' and '\n' aid in code organization. A comprehensive understanding of these symbols is fundamental for parsing and interpreting code accurately.
